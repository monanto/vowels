A vowel is a syllabic speech sound pronounced without any stricture in the vocal tract. Vowels are one of the two principal classes of speech sounds, the other being the consonant. Vowels vary in quality, in loudness and also in quantity. They are usually voiced and are closely involved in prosodic variation such as tone, intonation and stress. However, it is a myth that all words contain vowels because there are many that don't such as crypt, hymn and tryst.
